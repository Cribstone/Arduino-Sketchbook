Short example based on the Servo library example "Sweep" example and the Pulsed Light 3D examples.
The servo motor* is attached to pin 5 and rotates from 0-180 degrees continuously by 1 degree increments.
The LIDAR lite is attached to VCC (+5 V DC), GND, SDA and SCL.

This examples uses the Wire library.
