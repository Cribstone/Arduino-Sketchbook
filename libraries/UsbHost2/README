This is Rev.2.0 of MAX3421E-based USB Host Shield Library. Project web site is http://www.circuitsathome.com

Note from the Arduino Team:

this is unstable on Arduino ADK (and probably on other ADK compatible boards). We are working on getting this
fixed, but has a low priority as the USB_Host_Shield v1.0 library works in a VERY reliable way. Since this is FREE
SOFTWARE, feel free to take the code and see if you can patch it. We will be happy to include your suggestions
in the code.

It is of course based in the original by CircuitsAtHome.com and has been patched by Follower (RancidBacon.com)
