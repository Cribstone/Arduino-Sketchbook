HttpClient is a library to make it easier to interact with web servers from Arduino.

Dependencies:
- Requires the new Ethernet library API (with DHCP and DNS) which is in Arduino 1.0.

In normal usage, handles the outgoing request and Host header.  The returned status code is
parsed for you, as is the Content-Length header (if present).
