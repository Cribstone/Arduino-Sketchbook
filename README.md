# Arduino-Sketchbook
My Arduino Sketchbook hosted and syncronized on Github.  Please note: Most sketches in this repo are in an incomplete state of development or are being used as templates for use in new sketches.  Feel free to make a pull request if you see something that you would like to use in your own project.
With the above caveats in consideration if you have any questions please feel free to open up a new issue- https://github.com/Cribstone/Arduino-Sketchbook/issues and I'll do my best to answer!
